MCTS-and-Minimax-Othello


Coded for DS340 class: Intro to AI and Machine Learning, final project in Fall 2022

AI algorithms, MCTS and Minimax algorithms, for playing the boardgame Othello. Minimax coded using alpha beta pruning and is used to 
decrease amount of processing for the algorithm. MCTS algorithm is based off of Othello algorithm given for HW 2. 

Run code by uncommenting functions at bottom of page

Can play minimax algorithm against self, play against MCTS and have Minimax Algorithm play against the MCTS algorithm
