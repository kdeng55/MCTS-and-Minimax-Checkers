# MCTS-and-Minimax-Othello
#AI algorithms, MCTS and Minimax algorithms, for playing the boardgame Othello. Minimax coded using alpha beta pruning is used for minimax to 
#decrease amount of processing for minimax algorithm. 

#Run code by uncommenting functions at bottom of page
#Can play minimax algorithm against self, play against MCTS and have Minimax Algorithm play against the MCTS algorithm
